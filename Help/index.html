                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    Easy! Just send us your video and we might put it on our webcast -- or show it on iCarly.com! But remember, your parents have to give permission for you to send us your videos before we can even watch them. Then, we have to love your video before we show it. So don't send us boring stuff! And don't get all mad if you don't see your video right away. We're, like, super-busy with our web show and school stuff (homework). So it might be awhile before we watch your video. Just keep checking back to see if we pick your video to show!

                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    We update iCarly.com pretty often. We add video highlights for each web show (usually on Saturday night). We normally add your comments to the site on Tuesdays and update our pics on Thursdays. One of the coolest things on our site is our countdown clock (you can find it at the bottom of the homepage) -- and it tells you what we're gonna update next!

                    There are a bunch of places on our site where you can upload your videos. So, wherever you see the "upload video" button or wherever it says "Send us your videos here," just click it to upload a video. It's really easy!

                    <li>
                      Make sure your clothes don't have logos or bad words on them.

                    <li>

                    <li>
                      Don't say or show full names, school names, cities, street names, phone numbers, or email addresses in your video.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Try to keep your video shorter than 3 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Watch your video before you send it to us! Make sure it looks and sounds good. If it doesn't, try again and make it better.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Don't do anything dangerous. We don't want you to get hurt!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Your videos SHOULDN'T include music. But, if you're sending us a video of you dancing, and you want to include music, that's OK -- just don't talk during the music.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Always make and keep your own backup of your video. We can't send your video back to you. So, make and keep a copy for yourself!

                    What format does my video have to be in?
                  </div>
                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    If you are uploading video online, your video has to be in one of the following formats: .3gp, .3g2, .asf, .avi, .dv, .flv, .m4v, .mov, .mpg, .mpg2, .mpeg, .mpeg2, .mpeg4, .mp4, .qt, .wmv, .asf, .mp3, .wav, or .wma.
                    <p>
                      If you are sending us a video in the mail, please make sure your video is on a DV tape, a mini-DV tape, a VHS tape, a data CD or data DVD (as a digital file, such as QuickTime or .AVI).

                  </div>
                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    Typically any video shot on DV or mini-DV will look better than video shot on a phone or a digital camera.

                    Why am I having trouble uploading video to your site?
                  </div>
                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    There are many reasons you might be having trouble. Here are some:
                    <li>
                      Your video may be too large in file size (over 50 MB).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Your video may be too long (We recommend keeping your video shorter than 5 minutes long).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You must be registered and logged into iCarly.com to upload video.
                    </li>

                  <div class='FAQQuestion' id='FAQ25'>
                    Why can't I watch video on your site?
                  </div>
                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    The most likely reason you can't see video is that you do not have Flash 8. You'll need to download it before you can watch video on iCarly.com.

                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    You just do! Sorry -- it's, like, some "legal thing." Spencer explained it to us, but we got bored and stopped listening. Anyway, you just have to.

                    I uploaded my video. Why don't I see it on iCarly.com?
                  </div>
                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    First thing's first: If your parent hasn't approved the video, we can't show it. Second, we have to find time to watch it before we can decide if we like it or not. So keep checking back for your video. And don't lose hope! We may not have even watched it yet (We have a lot of homework, and running a web show takes a lot of energy!).

                    Do I have to register to upload videos?
                  </div>
                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    In order to upload videos to iCarly.com, you gotta have an iCarly user name. You also have to enter your parent's email address so we can let them know you've uploaded a video. Here's how it works: You create an account on iCarly. When you upload video, we'll ask you for your parent's email address. Then, we'll send your parent an email with a link to watch your video, and your parent can choose "accept" or "reject." Only AFTER your parent approves your video can we even watch it. If we love it, we might show it on iCarly.com or include it in our web show.

                    How many videos can I upload to iCarly.com?
                  </div>
                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    You can upload one video at a time, but you can come back (and upload more videos) as often as you like! Just please don't submit the same video twice.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    And remember, your parent and we have to approve each video before they go on iCarly.com or on our web show. So don't waste your time uploading stuff you know will never be approved by your parents and us! Also: DON'T give us your personal information in your video (last name, street address, school, phone numbers, or email addresses), don't wear clothes with brand logos, don't have music playing in background, don't use bad language, and don't do anything dangerous!!!

                  </div>
                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    We suggest that you keep your video under 5 minutes. The longer your video is, the harder it is for the computer to compress it, and the worse it will look on iCarly. Anyway, who wants to watch a long video online? Keep it under 5 -- for sure!

                    How long does it take to upload video to iCarly.com?
                  </div>
                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    The length of time it takes to upload a video depends on your computer's connection speed and the size of your video. With a high-speed Internet connection, videos generally take between 1 and 5 minutes to upload (per megabyte). But the speed is different for every computer, depending on connection speed -- so this is just a guess.

                      Make sure it doesn't look too dark or too bright.

                    <li>
                      Using the automatic flash on your camera will help keep your photo from being blurry -- but if your flash is TOO close, it can make your face too bright.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                      Photos may not display full names, school names, cities, street names, phone numbers, or email addresses. If they do, we can't use them!

                    Your photo might be too large for iCarly.com. Please make sure to keep your photo under 1 MB.

                    I uploaded my photo. Why don't I see it on iCarly.com?
                  </div>
                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    First thing's first: Check with your parent to see if they've approved your photo. If they haven't, we won't even look at it. If they have, we'll look at it to see if we love it. If we do, we might post it on iCarly.com or include it in our web show! So, keep checking back for your photo. And, don't lose hope! We might not have even watched it yet (We have a lot of homework, and running a web show takes a lot of energy!).

                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    In order to upload photos to iCarly.com, you gotta have an iCarly user name and password. You also have to enter your parent's email address so we can let them know you've uploaded a photo. Here's how it works: You create an account on iCarly. When you upload a photo, we'll ask you for your parent's email address. Then, we send your parent an email with a link to look at your photo and your parent can choose "accept" or "reject." Only AFTER your parent approves your photo can we even look at it. If we love it, we may show it on iCarly.com or include it in our web show.

                    You can upload one photo at a time, but you can come back (and upload MORE photos) as often as you like! Just please don't submit the same photo twice.

                  <div class='FAQAnswer'>
                    <p>
                      The length of time it takes to upload a photo depends on your computer's connection speed and the size of your photo. With a high-speed internet connection, photos generally take between 1 and 3 minutes to upload. But the speed is different for every computer -- so this is just a guess.
